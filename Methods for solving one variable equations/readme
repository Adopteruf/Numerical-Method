Here are 7 classical method for solving the one variable equations in numerical way.
1. Bisection Method
2. Fixed Point Iteration Method
3. Newton's Method
4. Secant Method
5. Method of False Position
6. Aitken's deta2 Method(can be applied on many methods here shows the application on Newton's Method)
7. Steffense's Method(can be applied on many methods here shows the application on Newton's Method)

Problem applied:
2: f(s) = -1.1.*s.*log(s*) - s, find s s.t. f(s*) = 0
1,3,4,5,6,7: f(s) = s.^3 - s.^2 - s - 1, find s s.t. f(s) = 0.
